Description: Contains functions, which print out introductions to whacky friends
    and pets in the console. The first introduces you to a person and gives 
    their occupation. The second introduces you to a pet and tells you which
    animal species they belong to. The user can preset the friend's (animal's)
    name and job (species) in the functions' arguments. Otherwise, the friend
    (pet) will be determined randomly.
